## STAR Reflection

**Situation:**  
1.While completing my WIL timesheets, I successfully submitted March but encountered an error when trying to save the January and February timesheets, even though all sign-ins and sign-outs were correctly recorded.
2.During my WIL internship at Plum Systems, I was required to complete a monthly report detailing the tasks I performed, attendance, and progress.


**Task:**  
1.I needed to clearly communicate this issue to my supervisors to ensure the problem could be resolved quickly and accurately, preventing delays in record-keeping.
2.I needed to provide a clear, professional summary of my work to my mentor and university, ensuring all activities were accurately documented.


**Action:**  
1.I drafted a professional email to my supervisors, Lucien and Tiffany, explaining the issue in detail. I attached a screenshot of the error to provide visual evidence and noted that my colleagues were experiencing the same problem. I requested guidance on how to resolve it.
2.I compiled weekly tasks, updated timesheets, documented progress, and included any challenges faced. I submitted the report in PDF format to my mentor and university for review.



**Result:**

1.The email effectively communicated the problem, allowing my supervisors to understand and address the issue. This demonstrated my ability to write professional, clear, and structured workplace communication, as well as my initiative in resolving problems.
2.The report clearly communicated my progress and performance. My mentorâ€™s feedback highlighted my ability to learn quickly and document work professionally. This demonstrated strong written communication and reporting skills.
