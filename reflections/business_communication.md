## STAR Reflection

**Situation:**

[Describe the situation at work]

**Task:**  
1.I needed to clearly communicate this issue to my supervisors to ensure the problem could be resolved quickly and accurately, preventing delays in record-keeping.

**Action:**  
1.I drafted a professional email to my supervisors, Lucien and Tiffany, explaining the issue in detail. I attached a screenshot of the error to provide visual evidence and noted that my colleagues were experiencing the same problem. I requested guidance on how to resolve it.

**Result:**
1. The email effectively communicated the problem, allowing my supervisors to understand and address the issue. This demonstrated my ability to write professional, clear, and structured workplace communication, as well as my initiative in resolving problems.
