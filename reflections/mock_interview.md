Action:
I prepared by reviewing questions and practicing responses. During the recording, I maintained positive body language, clear speech, and structured answers. Afterward, I reviewed the video to identify areas for improvement.

Result:
The video helped me improve confidence, refine my answers, and better present my internship experience. It strengthened my professional communication and prepared me for real interviews.
