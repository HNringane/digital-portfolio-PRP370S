## STAR Reflection

**Situation:**  
1.As part of my WIL and work readiness development, I was encouraged to build my professional network to prepare for post-graduation job opportunities.
2.During my WIL at Plum Systems, I needed to submit my To-Do List app to my supervisor, but the file size exceeded email limits.


**Task:**  
1.I needed to improve my online professional presence and connect with people in the IT field to expand my opportunities.
2.I had to communicate the issue professionally and ensure my supervisor could access the file without delays.

**Action:**  
1.I updated my LinkedIn profile with my WIL experience at Plum Systems, connected with industry peers, followed relevant technology pages, and engaged with professional posts.
I drafted a clear and polite email explaining the situation, attached proof of my upload attempt, and provided an alternative solution by sending the file via OneDrive.

**Result:**  
1.I enhanced my digital identity, received engagement from other professionals, and gained insight into potential IT career paths. This activity strengthened my communication and networking confidence.
2.The supervisor understood the issue and was able to access the file successfully. I demonstrated professional communication, problem-solving skills, and initiative in addressing technical challenges.
